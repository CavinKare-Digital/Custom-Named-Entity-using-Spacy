# Custom Named Entity Recognition using Spacy
 
###Named entity recognition (NER) is a sub-task of information extraction (IE) that seeks out and categorises specified entities in a body or bodies of texts. NER is also simply known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction.

#spaCy for NER
###SpaCy is an open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing in Python. It is designed specifically for production use and helps build applications that process and “understand” large volumes of text. It can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems, or to pre-process text for deep learning. Some of the features provided by spaCy are- Tokenization, Parts-of-Speech (PoS) Tagging, Text Classification and Named Entity Recognition.
